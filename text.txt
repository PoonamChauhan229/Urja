many more ...........
Prewritten function >> we just used it
we rae not at all worried about how it is written

functions >> number || array ||functions || object ||string ||Boolean  >>values


const navigate=useNavigate()  >> returns a function
navigate("path") //arguments is expecting a string >> "path"

function number(){
    return a*2
}

number(2) >> 4 
//number(2) >> double >>4 >>8 >>16 >>32

split("") >>splits up >> 

split()

function split(n,type)
//count of digits/string more 1 >> split 


useNavigate()  >> return function >> arguments as an string >>useNavigate("/path")
useState()     >> array >> destructre the arrays

const val=useState()  >> destructuring over the fly >> 
val is nothing but an array


const arr=[true,"hello",[3,4],{},test] // 3 values
console.log(arr[2])
function test(){
    console.log(test) // do the testing
}


// destructing  >> count is difficult
const [num1,num2,num3,num4,fun]=arr
console.log(num1,num2,num3,num4,fun)


let arr2=useState()
arr2 hold 2 values
initial value >>any datatype >> cold
function >> responsible for changing the state >> hot

const [state,setState]=useState() //syntax
//state >> initil value >> as an argumnet to useSatate
// setState >> changing the state



// 100 //1000  >> 

// 0 >1>2 changing the state
const [count,setCount]=useState(0) //count=0
const [name,setName]=useState("urja")   //name="urja"
const [age,setAge]=useState([10])     //age=10
const [email,setEmail]=useState({email:"urja@gmail.com"}) //email =urja@gmail.com
const [pass,setPass]=useState(true)

create a new application >>App.jsx create 20 variable >> inside the function  above the return statement


//lat a=20 , var const for the variable
// let b=45
// le anme="poonam"
// let 
// useState >> React variable
